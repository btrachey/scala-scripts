# Brian's Scala Scripts
Collection of utilities built with Scala Native that I use in various ways.

## find-scala-projects (fsp)
Lists all directories that contain a standard Scala build tool file
(`build.sbt`/`build.mill`/`project.scala`) at the root. Used as an external command by Wezterm to
create a project picker. See [this part]() of my wezterm config.
